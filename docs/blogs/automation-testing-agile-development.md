# Automation Testing in Agile Development

Automated tests are essential for agile development. They ensure that our software system is still 
easy to change. In an agile development process, software systems are changed and new feature are 
added in many short iteration. Without an automated testing setup it becomes a challenge to keep up 
your quality of your product.

The longer a product is in development, the harder it becomes for manual testing to keep up with the 
pace. Manual tests don't scale really well. Also, in an agile development team you want to continuously 
deploy your changes. For this, we need continuous testing to ensures that new code is bug-free before it 
hits the production environment.

In addition, our software systems are becoming more and more complex and need to be integrated with many 
external software systems that are maintained by other teams. We can't test our software system including 
all external systems. We would need to understand all these external systems and even get them in the 
right state for our tests. Also, these systems are changing, and we don't know how. Our tests would be 
dependent on external systems in relation to runtime, changes and bugs.

## Test only system that we are responsible for and fake all others

For stable tests, we need to simulate all interactions with external systems. In this case, we only test 
what we are responsible for, and thus we have a much more controlled testing strategy. Mokapi can help us 
to simulate interfaces like REST API or Apache Kafka and allows us to bring the really important information
into our system under test. 

This can help us to improve the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of testing. The 
software development team can identify and fix issues faster and ultimately deliver higher quality software
to the end user.
