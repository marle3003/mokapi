# End-to-End Testing with Mocked APIs Using Mokapi

Building reliable applications often depends on being able to test real-world scenarios ‚Äî including how your app 
behaves when communicating with external APIs. However, relying on real APIs during development and CI/CD 
pipelines can introduce problems like slow test runs, flaky results, or even test failures when external 
services are unavailable.

That‚Äôs where mocking APIs comes in.

## Why Mock APIs for Testing?

Mocking APIs allows you to simulate external systems under controlled conditions. This means:

- ‚ö° Faster and more reliable test runs 
- üéØ Full control over the data and behavior returned by APIs 
- üõ†Ô∏è Easier testing of error scenarios, timeouts, and edge cases 
- üîó No dependencies on the availability of third-party services

With [Mokapi](https://mokapi.io), you can easily define API mocks using [OpenAPI](/docs/guides/http/overview.md) or 
[AsyncAPI](/docs/guides/kafka/overview.md) specifications, and serve them locally or in your CI environment.
Mokapi even supports dynamic behavior using simple [JavaScripts](/docs/javascript-api/overview.md), helping you create more realistic test scenarios.

## How Mokapi Fits into Your CI/CD Pipeline

Running Mokapi during your automated tests helps isolate your systems and catch integration bugs earlier.
Here's what a typical flow looks like:

```shell
Code Push ‚Üí Start Mokapi ‚Üí Run Tests Against Mocks ‚Üí Stop Mokapi
```
You can even run Mokapi in your GitHub Actions workflows, making your CI/CD pipelines faster and more predictable.

## Example: GitHub Actions Workflow with Mokapi

Here's a basic example of using Mokapi in GitHub Actions:
```yaml
name: Node.js Backend Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Start Mokapi
        run: |
          docker run -d --rm --name mokapi -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 -v ${{ github.workspace }}/mocks:/mocks mokapi/mokapi:latest /mocks
          sleep 5  # Ensure Mokapi is running

      - name: Set Up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Stop Mokapi
        run: docker stop mokapi
```

In this setup, Mokapi runs as in a Docker container in GitHub Actions, making your mocked APIs available for the duration of your tests.

## Beyond the Basics: Advanced Mocking with Mokapi

Want even more control? Mokapi supports advanced mocking features, such as:

- **Simulating Timeouts** ‚Äî Test how your app handles slow APIs
- **Dynamic Responses** ‚Äî Return different data based on query parameters or headers
- **Error Scenarios** ‚Äî Force 500 errors or custom error messages to test error handling

You can even modify mocks dynamically during a test run with simple [JavaScripts](/docs/javascript-api/overview.md)!

## Local Development and Mokapi

Mokapi isn't just for CI. You can also run it locally during development.
There are many ways to run Mokapi depending on your setup ‚Äî learn more in the [Running Mokapi Guide](/docs/guides/get-started/running.md).

## Conclusion

Mocking APIs is a crucial part of building robust, scalable systems. With Mokapi, you can easily integrate mocking into your local 
development and CI pipelines, leading to faster feedback, fewer bugs, and better products.
