# Testing Kafka Workflows with Playwright and Mokapi

## Introduction

Modern applications rarely work in isolation. Instead, they communicate through **events** on Kafka topics, making
testing a challenge. How do you know your backend consumes the right command messages, processes them correctly,
and publishes the expected events?

This is where Mokapi comes in. Mokapi lets you **mock Kafka brokers** using
[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specifications or dynamic configuration. You can define your topics and schemas,
and then interact with them over a simple REST API. That means you donâ€™t need to spin up a real Kafka cluster just
for testing.

For end-to-end testing, we combine Mokapi with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Normally Playwright is used for
browser UI tests, but in this tutorial weâ€™ll use it to drive our workflow tests: producing Kafka messages, waiting for
backend processing, and validating the resulting events. (If youâ€™re wondering: Jest would also work here, but 
Playwright makes it easy to integrate with workflows that already involve UI.)

By the end, youâ€™ll see how a full event-driven workflow can be tested reliably without the overhead of managing a real
Kafka cluster.

## The Testing Scenario

Imagine this workflow:

- A foreign system publishes a **command** to the topic `document.send-command`.
- Our **backend service** (written in Node.js) consumes this command, simulates sending the document, and then publishes a **resulting event** to `document.send-event`.
- Our **test** (written in Playwright) acts as the foreign system:
  1. It produces a command message to `document.send-command` using Mokapiâ€™s REST API.
  2. It waits for the backend to process the command.
  3. It retrieves the resulting event from `document.send-event` and verifies the contents (such as `documentId` and `status`).  

This mirrors what happens in production: a message-driven workflow across multiple services. The only difference is
that for testing, Kafka itself is mocked by Mokapi.

## Defining Kafka Topics with AsyncAPI

The heart of this setup is the AsyncAPI specification. It declares the two topics we use:
- document.send-command (input command)
- document.send-event (output event)

Here is part of the API specification:

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Kafka Mock
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  mock:
    host: localhost:9092
    protocol: kafka

channels:
  document.send-command:
    description: Sending documents to customers
    messages:
      documentCommand:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/documentCommand'
  document.send-event:
    description: Events when sending documents
    messages:
      documentEvent:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/documentEvent'
```

## Setting Up the Backend

Our backend is a small Node.js service. It consumes commands from document.send-command, simulates sending a document, 
and publishes an event to document.send-event.

```javascript
import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs';

const kafka = new Kafka({
  clientId: 'backend',
  brokers: ['localhost:9092']
});

const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'backend-group' });
const producer = kafka.producer();

async function start() {
  await consumer.connect();
  await producer.connect();

  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'document.send-command', fromBeginning: true });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      const value = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
      console.log('Received command:', value);

      // Simulate sending the document
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 500));

      // Publish send-event
      const event = {
        documentId: value.documentId,
        status: 'SENT'
      };
      await producer.send({
        topic: 'document.send-event',
        messages: [{ key: value.documentId, value: JSON.stringify(event) }]
      });

      console.log('Published event:', event);
    }
  });
}

start().catch(console.error);
```

## Writing the Test with Playwright

Now letâ€™s test this workflow with Playwright and Mokapi.

1. Produce a command to document.send-command. 
2. Wait for the backend to publish an event to document.send-event. 
3. Retrieve the event and assert its contents.

We can access Mokapi's REST API either through Playwright's Page object or via fetch.

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const MOKAPI_API = 'http://localhost:8080/api/services/kafka/Kafka%20Mock';
const TOPIC_COMMAND = 'document.send-command';
const TOPIC_EVENT = 'document.send-event';

test('Kafka document send workflow', async () => {
    const documentId = 'doc-' + Date.now();
    let startOffset = -1
    console.log('using document ID: ' + documentId)

    await test.step('Get current offset for events', async () => {
        startOffset = await getPartitionOffset(TOPIC_EVENT, 0)
        console.log('current partition offset is: ' + startOffset)
    })

    await test.step('Produce a message to document.send-command topic', async () => {
        await produce(TOPIC_COMMAND, {
            key: documentId,
            value: {
                documentId: documentId,
                recipient: 'alice@mokapi.io',
                document: {
                    mediaType: 'text/plain',
                    fileName: 'test.txt',
                    content: 'Hello Alice'
                }
            }
        })
    })

    await test.step('Get messages from document.send-event', async () => {
        let record: any = undefined;
        const timeout = Date.now() + 5000;

        while (Date.now() < timeout && !record) {
            const records: any = await read(TOPIC_EVENT, 0, startOffset);
            console.log(records)
            record = records.find(x => x.value.documentId === documentId);
            if (record) {
                break    
            }
            startOffset += records.length
            // short delay before retry
            await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200));
        }
        expect(record, 'record should be found').not.toBeNull();
        expect(record.value.status).toBe('SENT')
    })
})

async function getPartitionOffset(topic, partition) {
  const res = await fetch(`${MOKAPI_API}/topics/${topic}/partitions/${partition}`);
  const data: any = await res.json();
  return data.offset
}

async function produce(topic: string, record: {key: string, value: any}) {
  const res = await fetch(`${MOKAPI_API}/topics/${topic}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      records: [
        {
          key: record.key,
          value: record.value
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  const data: any = await res.json();
  expect(data.offsets.every(x => !('error' in x))).toBe(true);
}

async function read(topic: string, partition: number, offset: number) {
  const res = await fetch(`${MOKAPI_API}/topics/${topic}/partitions/${partition}/offsets?offset=${offset}`)
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  return await res.json()
}
```

This test simulates the entire flow end-to-end â€” no mocks inside the backend, no shortcuts. Just a command going in, and an event coming out.

## Why This Matters

This example might feel simple, but the pattern is powerful:

- Spec-first: Mokapi uses AsyncAPI to define topics and message schemas. Tests validate against this shared contract. 
- Realistic simulation: youâ€™re testing exactly how your backend would behave in production. 
- Fast feedback: no need to set up and maintain a real Kafka cluster in your CI pipeline. 
- Scalability: add more backends and topics, and the test structure remains the same.

With Mokapi and Playwright, you get a full end-to-end test for an event-driven workflow without the heavy setup.

## Conclusion

Weâ€™ve built a full workflow test where:

- A command is produced to Kafka. 
- A backend consumes it and publishes an event. 
- A test verifies the event using Mokapiâ€™s REST API.

This pattern can be applied to much more complex event-driven architectures: multiple services, multiple topics, 
or more complex event payloads. However, the testing approach remains the same: Produce â†’ Consume â†’ Verify.

By mocking Kafka with Mokapi, you avoid the overhead of running real brokers in tests, while still validating real 
message flows. Combined with Playwright, this gives you a powerful way to ensure your event-driven applications 
work exactly as expected.
