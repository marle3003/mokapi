# Mocking APIs with Mokapi

**Welcome to Mokapi!**

Mokapi is your go-to platform for mocking APIs, making it easy to build,
test, and monitor API-driven applications without the hassle.

> *Think of Mokapi as your ever-reliable API contract guardian—lightweight, transparent, and specification-driven.*

## Build Better Software with Mokapi

In today's world, modern applications rely on multiple external APIs. 
When these APIs are slow, unreliable, or unavailable, they can impede 
your development process. Mokapi eliminates these obstacles, enabling
you to:

- **Develop Faster:** Eliminate waiting times by working independently of external systems.
- **Test with Confidence:** Simulate realistic API behaviors, including edge cases.
- **Automate Your Pipelines:** Enhance CI/CD reliability with consistent mock responses.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Seamlessly integrate tools like Dependabot or Renovate for future-proof dependencies.

## Key Features

- <p><strong>Spec-Driven Mocking:</strong><br />Quickly create OpenAPI or AsyncAPI mock servers for REST, SOAP, and event-driven architectures with minimal setup.</p>
- <p><strong>No-Code Configuration:</strong><br />Jump right in—no complex coding required!</p>
- <p><strong>Live Monitoring:</strong><br />Use the [Mokapi Dashboard](docs/guides/get-started/dashboard) to track requests and responses in real-time, simplifying your debugging process.</p>
- <p><strong>Dynamic Test Data:</strong><br />Utilize the built-in random data generator to create realistic payloads tailored to your API needs.</p>
