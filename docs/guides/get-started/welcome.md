## What is Mokapi

Mokapi is an open-source that allows developers to create 
and test API designs before actually building them. 

Using Mokapi, you can quickly and easily test different 
scenarios, such as delayed or failed responses, without 
having to rely on a fully functional API.

Mokapi will help you to improve the quality of the API and
clients reduce the risk of bugs or errors in production.
