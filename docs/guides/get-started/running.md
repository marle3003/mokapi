# Running Your First Mocked REST API with Mokapi

This quick-start guide will help you set up Mokapi and mock an HTTP REST API using 
the [Swagger Petstore](https://swagger.io/) specification. If you havenâ€™t installed 
Mokapi yet, check out the [Installation Guide](/docs/guides/get-started/installation.md).

## Mocking Petstore API
Run the following command to start Mokapi using the Petstore OpenAPI specification directly from the web:

```  
mokapi --providers-http-url https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

``` box=info
When you use Mokapi behind a corporate proxy, you probably need 
to skip SSL verification: "--providers-http-tls-skip-verify".
```

This launches Mokapi with the Petstore API on port 80 and the dashboard on port 8080. 
The mock API is accessible at /api/v3, as defined in the OpenAPI specification. 
Mokapi supports many options that can be passed in multiple places, check 
[options reference](/docs/configuration/reference.md) for more info.

## Test Your Mock REST API

You can now send a request to the mock API and receive a dynamically generated response:

```
curl --header "Accept: application/json" http://localhost/api/v3/pet/4
```

Mokapi generates a random response based on the OpenAPI specification. If multiple 
response formats are available, specifying the Accept header ensures you get the expected format.

``` box=info
 If no Accept header is sent, Mokapi will randomly select a content type 
 from the specification, which may lead to unexpected formats in responses.
```

## Analyze API and HTTP Request/Response

Mokapi provides a dashboard where you can see your mocked Petstore API and analyze your HTTP request.
Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

After navigating to the Petstore REST API, you can see all mocked endpoints including your logged request.

You can analyze your request and the corresponding response by clicking on the logged request in the *Recent Requests* table.
