# Kafka

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is commonly used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

## AsyncAPI

Mokapi with AsyncAPI can be used to simulate the behavior of a real Kafka system and test event-based applications.
By using Mokapi you can create a test environment that is closely to the production environment.
This allows you to identify and address issues before they impact the end-users.
This reduces the risk of downtime and other issues in the production environment and improves the reliability and robustness of you application.
Overall, Mokapi provides a powerful toolset for testing and validating event-based applications that rely on Kafka.
